We're going to rock the shizz.

>**Note**: You can add comments to an GitHub Issue by simply adding #3 or #(whatever number) to a commit comment.  And you can mark an issue as closed or fixed by adding "closed #3" or "fixed #3" to the comment.  I tested this out from Visual Studio - it works.


Visual Studio 2013 Premium Setup
-------------

Go ahead and make sure you're on **Update 3** and use **VS2013 Premium**.  Also, here's the extensions I have installed:

* Web Essentials
* Resharper (for bugs/todos in code)

Project Management

I installed the gmail add-on [Streak](https://www.streak.com/ "Streak") and added you to have Edit permissions on all pipelines (fancy words for spreadsheets :) ).  At the very least, we can use this to keep track of more business/organization-related things.   You should go ahead and install it, too. 

For example, I'm going to start putting feelers out soon to people on who would be interested to be drivers or businesses live and in the application before we actually go live - so that it isn't empty.  I need to track this simlarly to "Sales opportunities".  Streak is easy and will work nicely for this.
